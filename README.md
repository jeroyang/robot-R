robot-R
=======

My smart robot-R (R for radiology) can do several little things on my work:

    1. There is a fast CTRL-F1 shortcut to clockin or clockout. 
    2. Another shortcut F1 can toggle on/off the system volume. 
    3. Shortcut F2 can switch between radio channels defined in robot-R.ini. 
    4. And hide the ugly e-signature window automatically to keep my destop clean.
